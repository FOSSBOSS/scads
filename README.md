# scads
other scad projects. I dont write in openscad very often, and I usauly end up regretting it.
Dont get it twisted, Open Scad is loads of fun.

until your project takes on any level of complexity. 
You do everything in maths, with a C-esque syntax. 
It would have been my dream lanauge in 1999, which is exactly what it works like.

Rendering on a single core, nothing to help you do the math, limited measuring tools, 
no concept of interactive gui tools.

But it is free, and you can do some interesting things.

the most usefull thing in import multiple SVGs, so you can use proper artistic tools like 
inkscape to get meansurements. Then you can just drag in an svg. its handy.


Anyway, due to large gaps between where I want to use OpenScad, or 3D model anything at all, 
I forget how to do most of it, and end up with a bunch of intermediary projects to rapidly teach myself to learn openscad 
all over again.

So here is a dump of those projects from this weekend.
